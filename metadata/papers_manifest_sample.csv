"Preprint","Ye X,Xue X,Tian W,Xu Z,Xiao W,Li R","","Chunk Content is not Enough: Chunk-Context Aware Resemblance Detection for Deduplication Delta Compression","","","","","","arXiv [cs.DC]","","2021","","","","All","Similarity/Resemblance","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","","","","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01273","","","2106.01273","","With the growing popularity of cloud storage, removing duplicated data across users is getting more critical for service providers to reduce costs. Recently, Data resemblance detection is a novel technology to detect redundancy among similarity. It extracts feature from each chunk content and treat chunks with high similarity as candidates for removing redundancy. However, popular resemblance methods such as N-transform and Finesse use only the chunk data for feature extraction. A minor modification on the data chunk could seriously deteriorate its capability for resemblance detection. In this paper, we proposes a novel chunk-context aware resemblance detection algorithm, called CARD, to mitigate this issue.","","","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","","","","","","arXiv","2106.01273","cs.DC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","All Papers/Y/Ye et al. 2021 - Chunk Content is not Enough.pdf","","","",""
"Preprint","Sehat H,Pagnin E,Lucani DE","","Bifrost: Secure, Scalable and Efficient File Sharing System Using Dual Deduplication","","","","","","arXiv [cs.CR]","","2022","","","","All","Secure Dedup","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","","","","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10839","","","2201.10839","","We consider the problem of sharing sensitive or valuable files across users while partially relying on a common, untrusted third-party, e.g., a Cloud Storage Provider (CSP). This paper introduces Bifrost, an innovative file sharing system inspired by recent results on dual deduplication. Bifrost achieves the desired functionality and simultaneously guarantees that the CSP can efficiently compress outsourced data while only the sender and intended receiver can access the file after sharing.","","","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","","","","","","arXiv","2201.10839","cs.CR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","All Papers/S/Sehat et al. 2022 - Bifrost.pdf","","","",""
